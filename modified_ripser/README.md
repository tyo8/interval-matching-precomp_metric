# Ripser-image and Ripser (tight representatives), modified 

Garcia-Redondo and Song's modifications to [Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser/tree/image-persistence-simple) [2] and [Ripser-image](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser/tree/tight-representative-cycles) [3] needed to implement cycle matching. The changes constitute a single inserted line of code, which extracts a lexicographical refinement of indices correposding to simplices of persistence pairs. Garcia-Redondo and Song cede all credit for the files in these folders to the authors in [2] and [3].
